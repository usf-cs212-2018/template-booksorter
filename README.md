# Book Sorter

Eventually, you will need to be able to sort custom search result objects such that the most "important" result is listed first. You will also need to become familiar with nested classes before multithreading. This assignment is a step towards these goals.

## Requirements

The official name of this homework is `BookSorter`. This should be the name you use for your Eclipse Java project, the subdirectory used in your private GitHub homework repository, and the name you use when running the homework test script.

You must pass all unit tests when running the `/home4/public/cs212/homework` script on the lab computers **and** use the appropriate type of nested class where specified to receive a 100% on this homework assignment.
